##Instructions
The provided "run_analysis.R" script requires that the "UCI HAR Dataset" be in the current working directory for the r environment. 

To run it, simply execute run_analysis.R in RStudio. The tidy table data will be output to "<current working directory>/tidy_data.txt"

The script will produce the mean and standard deviation for each action and subject in the datset.
